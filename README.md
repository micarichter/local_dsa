# local_dsa

This repository contains all the data and code needed to reproduce results from the paper "Local dynamical survival analysis and epidemic surveillance panels for epidemic tracking and forecasting"

1) localDSA_functions.R contains all backend functions necessary for the code to run
2) ohio_all.csv contains the simulation results from one run of EpiCast in the entire state of Ohio
3) run_all_script.R produces all figures and tables in the manuscript when sourced. Note that this can take several minutes to complete.
